/*Concept Of Hashing gfg
What is Hash Table?
A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly.
 It operates on the hashing concept, where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct 
 index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, 
 it maps the keys with the value.

What is Load factor?
          A hash tableâ€™s load factor is determined by how many elements are kept there in relation to how
           big the table is. The table may be cluttered and have longer search times and collisions if the 
           load factor is high. An ideal load factor can be maintained with the use of a good hash function 
           and proper table resizing.



What is a Hash function?
A Function that translates keys to array indices is known as a hash function. The keys should be
evenly distributed across the array via a decent hash function to reduce collisions and ensure 
quick lookup speeds.

.
Collision resolution techniques:
Collisions happen when two or more keys point to the same array index. Chaining, open addressing, 
and double hashing are a few techniques for resolving collisions.

Open addressing: collisions are handled by looking for the following empty space in the table. If the
first slot is already taken, the hash function is applied to the subsequent slots until one is left
empty. There are various ways to use this approach, including double hashing, linear probing, and 
quadratic probing.


Separate Chaining: In separate chaining, a linked list of objects that hash to each slot in the hash 
table is present. Two keys are included in the linked list if they hash to the same slot. This method
 is rather simple to use and can manage several collisions.

Complexity Analysis of a Hash Table:
For lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, hash tables have an average-case time complexity of O(1).
Yet, these operations may, in the worst case, require O(n) time, where n is the number of elements 
in the table.
